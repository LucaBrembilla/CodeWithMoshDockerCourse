# CodeWithMoshDockerCourse

This repository contains the final result of the project used in ["The Ultimate Docker Course"](https://codewithmosh.com/p/the-ultimate-docker-course) by [CodeWithMosh](https://codewithmosh.com/) to study and understand Docker.

The only change to make when we want to run on a container provider our images is to add the IP of the remote docker machine inside /frontend/Dockerfile.prod.
